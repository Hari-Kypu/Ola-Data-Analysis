# Ola-Data-Analysis
 
### Overview  
This project involves the development of a comprehensive data analysis solution for a ride-sharing service using **Power BI** and **SQL**. The aim is to derive actionable insights into various aspects of the business, such as booking trends, vehicle performance, revenue optimization, cancellations, and user feedback through ratings.  








#### Project Features  

**SQL Analysis**  
1. **Successful Bookings**: Retrieval of all successful rides for operational performance evaluation.  
2. **Vehicle-Specific Metrics**: Calculation of the average ride distance per vehicle type.  
3. **Customer Behavior**: Identification of top customers by the number of rides and total booking value.  
4. **Cancellation Analysis**: Count of rides canceled by customers and drivers (segregated by reasons).  
5. **Ratings Assessment**: Maximum and minimum driver ratings for specific vehicle types, such as Prime Sedan.  
6. **Payment Insights**: Analysis of bookings completed via UPI.  
7. **Revenue Metrics**: Total revenue from successfully completed rides.  
8. **Customer Ratings**: Average customer ratings segmented by vehicle type.  
9. **Incomplete Rides**: A list of incomplete rides with reasons for non-completion.  

**Power BI Dashboard**  
The dashboard integrates the above analyses with interactive and visually appealing reports segmented into different operational views:  

1. **Overall Metrics**  
   - Ride Volume Over Time (time-series visual).  
   - Breakdown of Booking Statuses (pie chart).  

2. **Vehicle Insights**  
   - Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance.  

3. **Revenue Analysis**  
   - Revenue Distribution by Payment Method (stacked column chart).  
   - Top Customers by Booking Value.  
   - Ride Distance Distribution Per Day (stacked column chart).  

4. **Cancellations Analysis**  
   - Reasons for Cancellations by Customers (pie chart).  
   - Driver Cancellation Reasons (pie chart).  

5. **Ratings Evaluation**  
   - Driver Ratings
   - Customer Ratings.   

#### Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards, data cleaning, and transformation.  
- **SQL**: Data extraction and preparation using advanced queries.  

#### Deliverables
